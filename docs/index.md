	The documentation for SATAn is a WIP that is mostly intended as a small design documentation for myself.
	Due to the scope of this project some challenges required quite a lot of learning/ rethinking by approach to certain challenge .
	Documentation for end-users will follow later once a 0.1 state has been reached.

# Welcome to SAT Solver Analyzer (SATAn) ðŸ˜ˆ

An attempt at building a toolbox for analyzing performance and runtime characteristics of SAT solvers for \*nix systems.
This project is currently in its initial development stage.

It should cover the full benchmark cycle from:

- Orchestrating the execution of SAT solver on sets of test files
- Collecting metrics from solver output
- Storing metrics in somewhat normalized format
- Providing analysis tooling

In collaboration with and initiated by Benjamin Kaiser and Robert Clausecker.

Developed by Joshua KobschÃ¤tzki (Cobalt).
